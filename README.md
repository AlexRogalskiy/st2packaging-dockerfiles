## About StackStorm

[StackStorm](https://stackstorm.com/) is a powerful automation tool that wires together all of your apps, services and workflows. Itâ€™s extendable, flexible, and built with love for DevOps and ChatOps. It consists of bunch of services which bring Event-driven automation to you!

Here you can find Dockerfiles for *st2api, st2actionrunner, st2notifier etc* and all the services which StackStorm consists of.

## stackstorm container

Stackstorm container ([Dockerfile](Stackstorm/Dockerfile))  **is the base** for all of the **st2 services**. The full StackStorm stack is available inside the container. Notably that service containers such as *st2api, st2actionrunner etc* are basically the same container with the *stackstorm* container. The only hidden difference is the *ENV* settings. This approach minimizes the download snapshot when you want to run many stackstorm containers on the same node.
